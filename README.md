Get the number of CPUs available on the current system.

Sometimes the CPU will exaggerate the number of CPUs it contains, because it can
use
[processor tricks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_multithreading) to
deliver increased performance when there are more threads. This crate provides
methods to get both the logical and physical numbers of cores.

This information can be used as a guide to how many tasks can be run in
parallel. There are many properties of the system architecture that will affect
parallelism, for example memory access speeds (for all the caches and RAM) and
the physical architecture of the processor, so the number of CPUs should be used
as a rough guide only.

## Usage

```ts
import numCpus from "https://deno.land/x/num_cpus/mod.ts";

numCpus();
// => 8
```

run example:

```bash
deno run -A --unstable https://deno.land/x/num_cpus/example.ts
```

## Flags

- `--unstable`
- `--allow-plugin`
